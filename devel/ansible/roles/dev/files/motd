Welcome to the fedora-notifications development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at ~/fedora-notifications/

* Start and stop the Flask development server with
  `systemctl --user {action} flask.service`

* Start and stop the delivery service with
  `systemctl --user {action} fedora-notifications-delivery.service`

* All logs are viewable through `journalctl`

* You can type `workon fn` to enter a configured Python virtualenv

Once you start the development server, you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/
in your host's browser.

The RabbitMQ broker management interface is enabled and available at
http://localhost:15672/.

Finally, there is an IRC server listening on port 6667 which you can connect to
and receive test notifications on and a Postfix server which delivers all mail
to /var/spool/mail/vagrant.

Happy hacking!
